# Solana Monopoly Implementation Plan using Bolt ECS

## 1. Components
Based on the reference implementation, we'll create the following components:

### 1.1 Player Component
```rust
#[component]
#[derive(Copy)]
pub struct PlayerComponent {
    pub name: String,
    pub cash: u64,
    pub position: u8,
    pub jail_turns: u8,
    pub properties: Vec<u8>,  // Indices of owned properties
}
```

### 1.2 Property Component
```rust
#[component]
#[derive(Copy)]
pub struct PropertyComponent {
    pub name: String,
    pub color: u8,  // Enum index
    pub cost: u64,
    pub rent: [u64; 6],  // Base rent + 1-4 houses + hotel
    pub house_cost: u64,
    pub hotel_cost: u64,
    pub owner: Option<u8>,
    pub houses: u8,
}
```

### 1.3 GameState Component
```rust
#[component]
#[derive(Copy)]
pub struct GameStateComponent {
    pub current_player: u8,
    pub free_parking_pool: u64,
    pub community_chest_index: u8,
    pub chance_index: u8,
}
```

## 2. Systems

### 2.1 Movement System
- Handles dice rolling and player movement
- Manages passing GO
- Triggers property landing events
- Handles jail entry/exit

### 2.2 Property System
- Handles property purchases
- Manages rent collection
- Implements house/hotel building
- Handles property trading (future enhancement)

### 2.3 Card System
- Implements Chance card effects
- Implements Community Chest card effects
- Manages card deck state

### 2.4 Bank System
- Handles all monetary transactions
- Manages free parking pool
- Processes tax payments

## 3. World Program Implementation

### 3.1 Initialization
```typescript
// Create world instance
const worldPda = FindWorldPda(worldId);
const initWorldIx = createInitializeNewWorldInstruction({
    world: worldPda,
    registry: registryPda,
    payer: provider.wallet.publicKey,
});

// Initialize board state
const boardEntity = FindEntityPda(worldId, new anchor.BN(0));
const propertyComponents = initializeProperties(boardEntity);

// Initialize players
const playerEntities = initializePlayers(worldId, playerCount);
```

### 3.2 Game Flow
1. Player turns managed by GameState component
2. Movement system processes dice rolls and movement
3. Property/Card systems handle landing outcomes
4. Bank system processes all financial transactions

### 3.3 State Management
- All game state stored in components as Solana accounts
- PDAs used for deterministic account derivation
- Component updates handled through system instructions

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Setup
1. Initialize project with bolt-cli
2. Create basic components (Player, Property)
3. Implement World Program structure

### Phase 2: Basic Gameplay
1. Implement Movement System
2. Add Property System for basic buying/rent
3. Create Bank System for transactions

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add Card System
2. Implement house/hotel building
3. Add jail mechanics

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
1. Unit tests for all systems
2. Integration tests for game flow
3. Deployment to Solana testnet/mainnet

## 5. Technical Considerations

### 5.1 Account Management
- Use PDAs for all game-related accounts
- Implement proper account validation
- Handle account size limits appropriately

### 5.2 Transaction Handling
- Batch operations where possible
- Implement proper error handling
- Consider transaction size limits

### 5.3 Security
- Implement proper access controls
- Validate all state transitions
- Ensure atomic operations

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Unit Tests
- Test each system independently
- Verify component state changes
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 6.2 Integration Tests
- Test complete game flows
- Verify cross-system interactions
- Test concurrent operations

### 6.3 On-chain Testing
- Deploy to testnet
- Verify gas costs
- Test with multiple players
